# Bevy Monster Fighter

A simple RPG to test out [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

Currently in active development with placeholder graphics. Move with WASD and interact with menus with enter/escape. Enter the store and stress testing area through the doors, walk around in the grass to encounter various monsters and fight them to win (doesn't really do anything yet though). 

```
cargo run --release
```

## Contributing

Yes please! Any issues, bug fixes, code style fixes are welcome.  This is intended to be an educational project and I'm hoping it's a good example of using bevy to make a simple game.
